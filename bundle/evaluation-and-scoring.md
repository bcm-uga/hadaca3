## How is the scoring done?

Several **scores** (discriminating metrics) are computed on the estimated proportion matrix. These metrics are various ways of measuring the prediction error: mean absolute error, root mean square error and Pearson row- and column-correlations are computed by comparing the ground truth to the predictions estimated with the methods provided by the participants. They are combined into a single score to allow a straightforward comparisons of all the methods.
