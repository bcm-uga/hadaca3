This section provides you a dataset description and the baseline methods suggested by the organizer

                           
## Data                     
                           
The smoothies (16 vitamine composition of 10 mixtures, embed in the file `mixes_smoothies_fruits.rds`) to be deconvoluted are simulated **in silico** using fruit profiles (vitamine composition of each fruit, embed in the file `reference_fruits.rds`).

```
# read mixture data
mixes_smoothies_fruits = readRDS("mixes_smoothies_fruits.rds")
> dim(mixes_smoothies_fruits)

## Baselines                 
                           
A baseline is a simple approach designed to address the problem raised by the challenge â€” in this case, deconvolution. It serves as a straightforward method that is easy to understand and provides a foundation for further improvements.
The starting kit contains 3 baselines.

**submission_script.R** - This baseline uses a linear model (`lm` function) to estimate the fruit composition.
For improved estimation, you can comment line 24 and uncomment line 25 to apply a non-negative least squares deconvolution algorithm (`nnls::nnls` function).

**submission_script_installpkgcran.R** - This script demonstrates how to install a new package from CRAN if needed.

**Submission_script.py** (beta) - This Python script replicates the baseline approach from submission_script.R for Python users.
