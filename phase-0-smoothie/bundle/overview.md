Welcome to the *Smoothie Deconvolution* challenge, a toy model designed to introduce participants to the Health Data Challenge (HADACA), a series of data challenges focused on benchmarking deconvolution methods through crowdsourcing.

The HADACA challenge is a recurring event aimed at developping deconvolution methods for biological data.

- The **first edition** took place in 2018, in collaboration with the Data Institute at University Grenoble-Alpes.
- The **second edition** was held in 2019, in partnership with the Ligue contre le Cancer and sponsored by EIT Health.
- The **third edition** is set for December 2024, in collaboration with the M4DI project, part of the PEPR Santé Numérique. Visit the official website for details: http://hadaca3.sciencesconf.org.
    

                           
**Aim of the challenge**     
                           
This challenge is a toy challenge that allows you to get to grips with the platform, the tools and the concepts that will be covered.

The objective of this challenge is to estimate the fruit composition of different smoothies (mixtures to be deconvoluted) based on the vitamin composition of the smoothie, using the exact vitamin composition of each fruit (reference profile).
