## Organization            
                           
HADACA 3rd ed. is organized in closed collaboration between the **M4DI project, an axis of the PEPR santÃ© NumÃ©rique**, and the **ITMO Cancer Aviesan (2019-2024, project ACACIA)**. 

M4DI is dedicated to Methods and models for multimodal and multi-scale data integration. 

ACACIA (Artificial intelligence on multi-omics data to study tumor heterogeneity and develop clinical classifiers) is funded by the ITMO Cancer Aviesan call "Interdisciplinary approaches to oncogenic processes and therapeutic perspectives: Contributions of mathematics and informatics to oncology (MIC)".  

## Scientific committee : 

The role ot the scientific committee is to precisely define the scientific question, select appropriate datasets and evaluation metrics, and to design the challenge. 

-  A. Baudot (researcher in computational biology, MMG, Marseille, France),
-  Y. Blum (researcher in computational biology, IGDR, Rennes, France),
-  D. Causeur (professor in statistics, ), IRMAR, Rennes, France),
-  S. Dejean (researcher in statistic, IMT, Toulouse, France),
-  C. Lecellier (researcher in genomics, IGMM, Montpellier, France),
-  M. Richard (researcher in computational biology, TIMC, Grenoble, France),
-  M. TÃ©rÃ©zol (researcher in bioinformatics, MMG, Marseille, France).


In addition, 3 external expert have joined the committee : 

- Carl Herrmann (Professor in computational biology, Heidelberg University, Germany),
- Lionel Spinelli (researcher in computational biology),
- Franck Picard (researcher in statistics, LBMC, Lyon).
